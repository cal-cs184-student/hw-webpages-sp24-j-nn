      Task 1: Basic Triangle Rasterization
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      The goal of this task was to write code that, given a set of 3 points and
      a fill color, fills in points that are within the triangle. Our sample
      area consisted of a simple bounding box where we take the minimum and
      maximum x and y coordinates and set those as opposite corners.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      For each point/sample in the box, we then determined if it was contained
      in the triangle by performing 3 half plane tests. Each half plane test
      involved drawing normal vectors to each of the triangle's lines and taking
      the dot product with the vector between one of the line's endpoints and
      the point, giving us a positive number if the point is on the same side as
      the normal vector, 0 if it's on the line, and a negative number if it's on
      the opposite side. If the signs of each of the half plane tests are all
      equal (the signs can be negative or positive depending on which endpoints
      are used and if the points are oriented clockwise or counter-clockwise),
      it means that the point is in the triangle!
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm">
      Unfortunately no optimizations were added, so our algorithm matches the
      performance of the naive bounding box rasterization algorithm.

          Triangles rasterized using our algorithm, notice that since we're only
          using 1 sample per point, there are some jaggies at the edges of the
          triangles.

    <p class="text-lg font-semibold pb-4">Task 2: Supersampling</p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      The last figure showed that while our rasterization algorithm draws
      triangles as we expect, the edges still have a lot of jaggies. We can
      remedy this by increasing the number of samples per point and averaging
      the color of all of the subsamples to get a more "accurate" color than the
      solid color that we were filling in earlier. As an example, if we increase
      the sampling rate to 4, we divide our pixel into a sqrt(sampling rate) x
      sqrt(sampling rate) grid of "mini-pixels" and sample those instead of just
      the center.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      To implement this in code, we modified our original rasterization
      algorithm to account for sampling rate, so instead of just sampling at the
      center of each pixel within the bounding box, we iterated over each
      subsample's location and placed it into a resized sample buffer that is
      sample_rate times bigger than the original and places subsamples for each
      pixel contiguously.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      We then modified the rendering functions to account for our sampling rate
      as well, so when rendering pixels, instead of pulling from the sample
      buffer, the rendering function takes the average of the sampling_rate
      samples corresponding to the pixel. The buffers are also cleared after
      changing sample rates to prevent any edge artifacts from the previous
      sample_buffer corresponding to another sampling rate.

    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      In this task, we implemented the translation and rotation matrices so that
      we could render an svg containing various shapes transformed to form a
      figure called Cubeman. We modified the svg to have the Cubeman waving to
      us by rotating both arms and also rotating the end segment of the raised
      arm. Hello!

    <p class="text-lg font-semibold pb-4">Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      Barycentric coordinates are an alternative way of representing points
      within a triangle where we represent a point as as a weighted sum of the
      vertices (alpha * A + beta * B + gamma * C, alpha + beta + gamma = 1). If
      we put a point inside the triangle and draw lines to each of the vertices,
      the coefficient for each vertex is the ratio of the triangle opposite that
      vertex to the entire area of the triangle.

    <p class="text-lg font-semibold pb-4">Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</p>
    <p class="text-sm pb-2">
      Pixel sampling is the process of determining the color of a texture element 
	  so that we can apply it to each respective pixel on the screen. We implemented 
	  There are two main methods: nearest and bilinear interpolation. For nearest sampling, 
	  we just selected the texel nearested to the texture coordinates by rounding it to the 
	  nearest integer and using the level of detail to retrieve the texels from the texture. 
	  It's quick and easy, but can result in more blocky looking artifacts. On the other hand, 
	  bilinear sampling, is more computationally heavy as we calculate the pixel by interpolation
	  between four texels around the texture coordinate. I took the next highest and lowest integer 
	  as the four texels, and then used lerp to calculate the weighted average of the color. It 
	  produces much smoother colors, but the tradeoff is that it's slightly slower.

		When pressing "P," you can see the difference in the longitudinal and latitudunal lines 
		in the linear and nearest. You can see how in img/task5_sr1_nearest.png, where the sampling 
		rate is 1 and we're applying nearest sampling, the red equator is more blocky compared to 
		img/task5_sr1_linear.png, where the sampling rate is also 1 but we're applying billinear
		sampling. The difference is even more noticeable with a larger sampling rate of 16, as
		if you were to look at where China is supposed to be on the globe, the colors appear
		more blocky. It doesn't have as much as a smooth color gradient in the nearestest 
		sampling than in the bilinear. There's a larger difference when you're looking at a
		certain area in the distance. It's not as noticeable when you're looking at Africa
		as it's smack down in the middle, but since China is farther and there's more texture
		gradient the blocky artifacts are more noticeable.

	<p class="text-lg font-semibold pb-4">Task 5: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</p>
	<p class="text-sm pb-2"> 
		Level sampling is used to improve the image quality and rendering with the different levels of detail.
		Similar to a pyramid, we generate a series of progressively smaller versions of the original texture, 
		and so each mipmap level has a different level of detail of the original texture. We implemented this by
		taking the derivatives of the texture coordinates (du/dx, du/dy, dv/dx, dv/dy), which represents the change
		of texture coordinates in the screen. We then select the maximum value in the u or v direction, and depending
		on the selected sampling method (nearest or linear), the texture color is obtained from the mipmap level.
	</p>

	<p class="text-sm pb-2"> 
		Tradeoffs between these pixel sampling, supersampling, and level sampling include speed, memory, and antialising
		power. Pixel sampling is the fastest and uses the least amount of memory, but has horribe antialising. When zoomed
		in, you can see how blocky lines and colors are. Even at a glance, you could see the jagged lines. Supersampling 
		is slower than pixel sampling as you are doing more iterations, but it's most likely faster than level sampling.
		It also consumes more memory as you have store more samples per pixel, compared to pixel sampling. However, the lines
		and edges are much more smooth and reduces the appearances of "jaggies". Lastly, level sampling is still pretty fast
		but consumes the most memory. Though, this tradeoff is because it has the best antialising capabilities as it uses
		lower-resolution textures for distant or smaller objects, and this improves the quality of the rendering.
