<h1>Project 3: Pathtracer</h1>

<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>

<h3>Explanation of Ray Generation</h3>
<p> We begin by converting the pixel coordinates to represent the position within the image plane
  and are normalized to the range [0, 1], which is then transformed into camera coordinates.
  We use the function ('tan') to calculate horizontal and vertical offsets from the center of the 
  plane. Then the camera-to-world transformation matrix ('c2w') is applied to the camera coordinates
  so we can obtain the direction of the ray in world space. The resulting direction vector is normalized,
  the generated ray is constructed with its origin at the camera position ('pos'), and its direction is set
  to the computed ray direction. 
</p>

<h3>Explanation of Triangle/Sphere Intersection</h3>
<p> In the functions bool Triangle::has_intersection and bool Sphere::has_intersection, we are determining
  whether a ray intersects with a triangle using barycentric coordinates. In the class Triangle, it calculates the
  intersection point and checks if it's within the boundaries, returning true if so. While in Sphere, the 
  function checks whether a ray interects with a sphere by solving the quadratic equation derived from the
  ray's equation and the sphere's implicit equation.
