			Task 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals
		  </p>
		  <p class="text-sm pb-2">
			To implement the vertex normals, I first took the half-edge and iterated through
			the neighboring triangles with the vertex. Then, I found the normal of each triangle
			by calculating the cross product of its edges. I would then sum up the normals of the triangle
			of all neighboring triangles.

			Task 4: Edge Flip
		  </p>
		  <p class="text-sm pb-2">
			I first checked if an edge was a boundary, and would just return if it 
			was. If not, then I would find all the relevant information, to find all
			the edges (bc, cb, bd, ca, ab, and dc). I noticed that bc and its twin 
			cb could be used to find the two faces of the left triangle and the right
			triangle. Following the diagram in lecture, I would see that I would have to
			find the neighbor and the triangle. I used trial and error, which might not
			have been the most efficient thing, to realize how to find the vertex of each
			of the half edges. When I set the neighbors of each edge to flip the edge, I ran 
			into the error where I was incorrectly setting the vertices, and it was giving me 
			a black spot where I was trying to flip the edges.
